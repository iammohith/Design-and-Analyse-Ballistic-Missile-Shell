# Design and Analyse Ballistic Missile Shell

## Abstract
The design and analysis of ballistic missile shells encompass both structural and flow analyses to validate their performance. Structural analysis focuses on key parameters such as damage tolerance, lifespan, factor of safety, total deformation, and stress levels to assess the potential impact of the missiles at various speeds.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis is extensively employed to study aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. This approach allows for the evaluation of critical quantities such as lift and drag, as well as field properties including pressure distributions and velocity profiles. The results obtained from these analyses are essential for validating missile designs, ensuring that they meet performance criteria and safety standards.

##Conclusion

In conclusion, all of the missiles demonstrated significant impact and aerodynamic stability at speeds below 5000 m/s. However, some missile designs require speed optimization, as they have successfully endured up to 100 cycles in fatigue testing. The application of filleting to the sharp edges greatly contributed to reducing the overall volume of the missiles while enhancing their aerodynamic performance. For the assembly process, rivet joints are recommended due to their time efficiency and structural stability. I was particularly successful in achieving the design objectives for the tenth missile, which demonstrated both greater impact potential and improved aerodynamic stability. Overall, this project provided a valuable learning experience, giving me substantial exposure to missile research and development.
