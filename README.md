# Design and Analyse Ballistic Missile Shell

The design and analysis of ballistic missile shells encompass both structural and flow analyses to validate their performance. Structural analysis focuses on key parameters such as damage tolerance, lifespan, factor of safety, total deformation, and stress levels to assess the potential impact of the missiles at various speeds.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis is extensively employed to study aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. This approach allows for the evaluation of critical quantities such as lift and drag, as well as field properties including pressure distributions and velocity profiles. The results obtained from these analyses are essential for validating missile designs, ensuring that they meet performance criteria and safety standards.
